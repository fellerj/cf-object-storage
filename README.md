## Background

Static Large Objects (SLOs) and Dynamic Large Objects (DLOs) are incredibly useful aggregate file types available
in OpenStack Object Storage. However, manipulating them can be quite difficult. This Cloud Foundry CLI plugin is
designed to make using SLOs and DLOs much more accessible. 

This plugin makes heavy use of the [swiftlygo](https://github.com/ibmjstart/swiftlygo) library. Much more information 
on SLOs and DLOs can be found by reading that library's README.

Additionally, some basic object and container interactions are included as commands. This allows for working with
Object Storage from the command line without having to go through the long authentication process on your own.

## Install

Since this plugin is not currently in an offical Cloud Foundry plugin repo, it will need to be downloaded and installed
manually. 

#### Install From Binary (Recommended)

- Download the binary for your machine ([Linux](https://github.com/ibmjstart/cf-large-objects/tree/master/binaries/linux/cf-object-storage?raw=true), [Mac](https://github.com/ibmjstart/cf-large-objects/tree/master/binaries/darwin/cf-object-storage?raw=true), [Windows](https://github.com/ibmjstart/cf-large-objects/tree/master/binaries/windows/cf-object-storage.exe?raw=true))
- Navigate to the downloaded binary
- Install the plugin with `cf install-plugin cf-object-storage`
 -  If installing gives you a permission error run `chmod +x cf-object-storage`
- Verify the plugin has been installed with `cf plugins`

**Note:** If you are reinstalling, run `cf uninstall-plugin cf-object-storage` first to uninstall the outdated
version.

#### Install From Source

Installing this way requires Go. To download the package, run
```
go get github.com/ibmjstart/cf-object-storage
```

The provided `reinstall.sh` script can then be ran to install the plugin.

**Note:** `reinstall.sh` first attempts to uninstall the plugin, so you may get a failure message from the uninstall
command. This will certainly happen the first time you install. However, as long as the following install succeeds all
should work fine.

## Usage

This plugin is invoked as follows:
`cf os SUBCOMMAND [ARGS...]`

Sixteen subcommands are included in this plugin, described below. More information can be found by using `cf os help` followed by any of the subcommands.

#### Subcommand List

Subcommand		|Usage															|Description
---		|---															|---
`auth` | `cf os auth service_name [-url] [-x]`										|Retrieve and store<sup>!</sup> a service's x-auth info
`containers` | `cf os containers service_name` | Show all containers in an Object Storage instance
`container` | `cf os container service_name container_name` | Show a given container's information
`create-container` | `cf os create-container service_name container_name [headers...] [r] [-r]` | Create a new container in an Object Storage instance
`update-container` | `cf os update-container service_name container_name headers... [r] [-r]` | Update an existing container's metadata
`rename-container` | `cf os rename-container service_name container_name new_container_name` | Rename an existing container<sup>!!</sup>
`delete-container` | `cf os delete-container service_name container_name [-f]` | Remove a container from an Object Storage instance
`objects` | `cf os objects service_name container_name` | Show all objects in a container
`object` | `cf os object service_name container_name object_name` | Show a given object's information
`put-object`    | `cf os put-object service_name container_name path_to_source [-n object_name]` | Upload a file to Object Storage
`get-object` | `cf os get-object service_name container_name object_name path_to_download` | Download an object from Object Storage
`rename-object` | `cf os rename-object service_name container_name object_name new_object_name` | Rename an object
`copy-object` | `cf os copy-object service_name container_name object_name new_container_name` | Copy an object from one container to another
`delete-object` | `cf os delete-object service_name container_name object_name [-l]` | Remove an object from a container
`create-dynamic-object`	| `cf os make-dlo service_name dlo_container dlo_name [-c object_container] [-p dlo_prefix]`				|Create a DLO manifest in Object Storage
`put-large-object`	| `cf os make-slo service_name slo_container slo_name source_file [-m] [-o output_file] [-s chunk_size] [-t num_threads]`	|Upload a file to Object Storage as an SLO

**<sup>!</sup>** `auth` checks if `HOME/.cf/os_creds.json` exists and contains the target service's credentials. If it does,
these credentials are used to authenticate with Object Storage (which saves a few http requests). Upon successful 
authentication, `auth` will save a service's credentials to the above location to speed up subsequent commands.

**<sup>!!</sup>** `rename-container` should not be used (and will likely fail) on containers containing SLOs and DLOs. This is due to their strict naming conventions that expect certain containers to have certain names.
