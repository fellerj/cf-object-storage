## Background

Static Large Objects (SLOs) and Dynamic Large Objects (DLOs) are incredibly useful aggregate file types available
in OpenStack Object Storage. However, manipulating them can be quite difficult. This Cloud Foundry CLI plugin is
designed to make using SLOs and DLOs much more accessible. 

This plugin makes heavy use of the [swiftlygo](https://github.com/ibmjstart/swiftlygo) library. Much more information 
on SLOs and DLOs can be found by reading that library's README.

Additionally, some basic object and container interactions are included as commands. This allows for working with
Object Storage from the command line without having to go through the long authentication process on your own.

## Install

Since this plugin is not currently in an offical Cloud Foundry plugin repo, it will need to be downloaded and installed
manually. 

#### Install From Binary (Recommended)

- Download the binary for your machine ([Linux](https://github.com/ibmjstart/cf-large-objects/tree/master/binaries/linux/cf-large-objects?raw=true), [Mac](https://github.com/ibmjstart/cf-large-objects/tree/master/binaries/darwin/cf-large-objects?raw=true), [Windows](https://github.com/ibmjstart/cf-large-objects/tree/master/binaries/windows/cf-large-objects.exe?raw=true))
- Navigate to the downloaded binary
- Install the plugin with `cf install-plugin cf-large-objects`
- Verify the plugin has been installed with `cf plugins`

**Note:** If you are reinstalling, run `cf uninstall-plugin cf-object-storage` first to uninstall the outdated
version. Additionaly, if installing gives you a permission error run `chmod -x cf-large-objects`.

#### Install From Source

Installing this way requires Go. To download the package, run
```
go get github.com/ibmjstart/cf-large-objects
```

The provided `reinstall.sh` script can then be ran to install the plugin.

**Note:** `reinstall.sh` first attempts to uninstall the plugin, so you may get a failure message from the uninstall
command. This will certainly happen the first time you install. However, as long as the following install succeeds all
should work fine.

## Usage

This plugin is invoked as follows:
`cf os SUBCOMMAND [ARGS...]`

Twelve subcommands are included in this plugin, described below. More information can be found by using `cf os help` followed by any of the subcommands.
